# Venn MEV custom detector

This project implements a custom detector designed to identify potential MEV activities, specifically focusing on sandwich attacks

[What is a sandwich attack](https://trustwallet.com/blog/security/what-are-sandwich-attacks-in-defi)

**Detection Logic:**

The detection service (`src/modules/detection-module/service.ts`) analyzes transaction traces based on several heuristics:

1. **EOA wallet call to contract, which triggers internal calls** Sandwich transactions, as well as other types of MEV, require creating custom smart contracts. In sandwiches, contracts should be able to trade tokens using different DEX pools
2.  **Presence of Swaps:** Detecor checks if the transaction trace contains calls to known swap functions (e.g., Uniswap V2/V3/V4, 1inch V5).
3.  **Tokens Flow:** Detector verifies, that the transaction is not just a sophisticatedly-routed swap, by checking that no tokens traded are returned to original contract caller (it's a common practice among MEV bots as it allows to save a lot of gas by not transferring tokens back to the 'owner' and keeping them inside contract)
4.  **Contract Verification (Optional):** If an `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` is provided, it checks if the supposed MEV contract is verified on Etherscan. MEV bots ony use unverified contracts, whereas DeFi protocols usually verify theirs.

A transaction is flagged as a potential sandwich attack only if all of the aforementioned heuristics apply to it.

_P.S. This detector focuses on sanwich attacks, but most of these checks can be used for detecting other types of mev_
